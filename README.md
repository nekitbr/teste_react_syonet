This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, using VSCode, install the extensions [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). The lint-on-save is already configured inside .vscode folder.

Then, using _pnpm_ you can start a development server with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the homepage screen.
